Emanuele Moscato is a data scientist, teacher and researcher with international experience based in Milan, Italy.

After graduating in Physics at the University of Milano-Bicocca (Milan, Italy), he went on to get a PhD in Theoretical Physics at Queen Mary, University of London (London, UK), where he took part in an international collaboration applying String Theory to tackle some of the puzzles of black hole physics (see his publications <a href="/publications/">here</a>).

After discovering Data Science and Machine Learning, Emanuele worked as a Data Scientist in companies in the UK and then in Italy, applying scientific reasoning to solve business problems.

A teacher at heart, throughout his career he taught courses both in academia (Physics) and in companies (Data Science), experimenting also with teaching Maths and Physics for a term in an italian high school.

Passionate about research, Emanuele has always been keen of learning new techniques, understanding the underlying theory and expanding what's possible. He's currently a postdoctoral researcher in Natural Language Processing at Bocconi University.
