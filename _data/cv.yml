    - title: PhD
      institution: Queen Mary, University of London, London, UK
      year: 2017
      description:
        - Explored black hole physics problems (the information paradox) using
          holography (AdS/CFT correspondence), a technique from string theory
          that allows to map a problem in gravitational physics onto a problem
          in particle physics in one fewer dimension.
        - Analytical work using real, complex and functional analysis, differential
          geometry, algebra and topology.
        - Work was carried out as part of an international collaboration and
          culminated in three published peer-reviewed papers.
    - title: Msc in Physics
      institution: Università di Milano-Bicocca, Milan, Italy
      year: 2014
      description:
        - Specialized in theoretical physics.
        - Attended courses in group theory, quantum field theory, statistical mechanics,
          general relativity, numerical methods in statistical mechanics (molecular
          dynamics, Monte Carlo Markov Chains).
        - Finished with mark 110/110 with honours.
    - title: Bsc in Physics
