This is the second proper course in Quantum Mechanics for Physics students at Queen Mary, University of London (London, UK). While the first course was of an introductory nature and only worked with wavefunctions (in position space), QMB introduced the more general Dirac bra-ket notation, and more general notions of quantum states.
