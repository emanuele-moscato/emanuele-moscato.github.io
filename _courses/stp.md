This is the Statistical Mechanics course for Physics students at Queen Mary, University of London (London, UK). After a review of the basics of thermodynamics, statistical ensembles are introduced. The last part of the course is dedicated to quantum statistical mechanics, with the discussion of the Bose-Einstein and the Fermi-Dirac statistics.
